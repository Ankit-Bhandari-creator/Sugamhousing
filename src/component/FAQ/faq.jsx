              <p>
                Owning a home is a big responsibility. You need to be
                financially stable and ready to take on the responsibilities of
                homeownership. Here are some questions to ask yourself:

              <summary>Is Renting or Buying Better?</summary>
              <p>
                Renting is often more affordable in the short term, but buying a
                home can be a better long-term investment. Consider your
                financial situation and future plans before making a decision.

              <summary>What Is the Lenderâ€™s Formula?</summary>
              <p>
                Lenders typically use a formula that considers your income,
                debts, and credit score to determine how much you can borrow. A
                common rule of thumb is that your monthly mortgage payment
                should not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income.

              <p>
                When looking for a home, consider factors such as location,
                size, condition, and amenities. Make a list of your must-haves
                and nice-to-haves to help narrow down your options.

              <summary>Do I Need a Home Warranty?</summary>
              <p>
                A home warranty can provide peace of mind by covering the cost
                of repairs or replacements for major systems and appliances.
                However, itâ€™s not always necessary, especially if youâ€™re buying
                a new home with warranties on the systems and appliances.

              <summary>What Should I Expect at Closing?</summary>
              <p>
                Closing is the final step in the home buying process. Youâ€™ll
                sign a lot of paperwork, pay closing costs, and receive the keys
                to your new home. Itâ€™s important to review all documents
                carefully and ask questions if you donâ€™t understand something.

              <summary>What Is Pre-approval?</summary>
              <p>
                Pre-approval is a process where a lender evaluates your
                financial situation and determines how much they are willing to
                lend you. Itâ€™s a good idea to get pre-approved before you start
                house hunting, as it can give you a better idea of your budget
                and make you a more attractive buyer to sellers.

              <p>
                Renting can be a great option if youâ€™re not ready to buy a home.
                Consider your financial situation, lifestyle, and future plans
                before making a decision. Make sure you understand the terms of
                the lease and what is expected of you as a tenant.

              <p>
                When making an offer on a home, consider the current market
                conditions, the condition of the home, and your budget. Itâ€™s a
                good idea to work with a real estate agent who can help you
                determine a fair offer price.
